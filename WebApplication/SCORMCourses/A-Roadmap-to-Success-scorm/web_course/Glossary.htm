					<ul>
						<li>Requires Federal employers not to discriminate against qualified job applicants or employees with disabilities. Persons with disabilities should be permitted to compete at all grade levels and for all occupational series commensurate with their qualifications. Federal employers should ensure that their policies do not unnecessarily exclude or limit persons with disabilities because of a job's structure or because of architectural, transportation, communication, procedural, or attitudinal barriers.</li>
						<li>Requires employers to provide &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; to qualified applicants and employees with disabilities unless doing so would cause undue hardship to the employers. Such accommodations may involve, for example, restructuring the job (subject to retaining essential functions), modifying work schedules, adjusting or modifying examinations, providing readers or interpreters, and acquiring or modifying equipment and/or facilities (including the use of adaptive technology such as voice recognition software).  Reassignment may also be appropriate as a last resort.</li>
